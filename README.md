### day1 goal: make tank move and turret turn.
  * basic game loop done
  * basic angle/drawing done
  * camera/tarrain code is more complex than I presumed.

### day2 goal: finish tank move/velocities code
  * safe map bounds
  * implemented tank and turret controls
  * driving tank around looks awesome :)
  * remember to draw sprites in zero angle direction

### day3 goal: basic networking
